As I was creating the test directory, I found out that the idea of creating an init file was neccessary. 
so I am creating an init file for all the directories and also in the main depository

I am adding an init file in the depository in the capstone-tps25 directory


Created a test 


I changed my repository name in GitHub and used "git remote -v" to check the current depository url and updated it with  "git remote set-url orgin <new-repo-url>".
With this I will fetch and push to the actual depository. Once I updated the url in my local repo I also updated the name in my local repo


Create a config.py file for storing the API keys
    took the three steps of add, commit, and push to my depository.


Create a data directory
Create a screenshots directory
create a requirements file
